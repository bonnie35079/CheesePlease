    <p>I created this webpage to show people how to properly breakdown a wheel of cheese. While each cheese has specific guidelines on how they should be cut I am going to show you specifically how to breakdown a large wheel of Gouda.</p>

    <p> We start with a full wheel of uncut cheese </p>

    <img src="media/FullWheel.jpg" alt="Digital photo of full wheel of cheese" width="650"/>

    <p> Then we simply cut the full wheel in half </p>
